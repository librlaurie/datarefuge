# Technical channels for DataRefuge:

Order of preference for saving datasets:
1. Web Archiving.
1. Web Scraping + WARC
1. Download and Upload to CKAN

## Part One: Gathering and Sorting

Lots of work has been done by EDGI, and we have a team of volunteer librarians and archivists working on this part. It will rely on a variety of sources:

**Gathering**
1. Survey currently sent through wide distribution channels to gather lists of valuable/vulnerable data
- Metadata volunteers are double checking these to ensure that we have the right data for each dataset, and to pull like ones together. Once this is done, this will be the list used for part two below.
2. Crawls of government websites using sitemaps and tools (from EDGI) to identify  -  need to link to appropriate how-tos from EDGI for the web crawling parts.
- Check these against 1, to de-dupe and to add metadata

**Sorting**
1. Metadata volunteers and some scripts to de-dupe, organize by agency, check other sources, and classify into those that can be added to EoT and those that can't.

## Part Two: Using a list of pre-sorted datasets and datasources

For:

**Those that can be added to internet archive:**

- Build on the tools in the [EDGI github site](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/) to seed internet archive. (more docs here, and a [great overview](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/eot-sprint-toolkit).. More to come.



For:

**Those that can't or shouldn't be added to Internet Archive:**

For each:

- Download and save. (methods tbd, and mostly one at a time).
- Create metadata in standard form (in collab w/ Michigan Librarians).
- Upload to CKAN on AWS.

**Other tasks:**
